# BibleDigger
A web app containing Bible translations in over 1,500 languages with convenient single- or parallel-text browsing, 
verse search, concordance, and word list tools for linguists working with bible translations.

What I learned:
* web scraping with requests/urllib and Beautiful Soup
* handling a vast range of unicode symbols in different writing systems and non-printing characters (e.g. right-to-left mark) with unicodedata
* creating SQLite database, connecting and quering it with SQLAlchemy
* Bootstrap/HTML/CSS
* Flask
* Basic Javascript to create dynamic dropdown lists, pagination, and concordance sorting
* Basic jQuery to handle element attributes
