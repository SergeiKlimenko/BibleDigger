# BibleDigger
A web app containing bible translations in over 1,500 languages with convenient tools for linguists working with bible translations:
* single- or parallel-text browsing,
* verse search in single or parallel texts
* concordance
* word list

What I learned:
* web scraping with requests/urllib and Beautiful Soup
* handling a vast range of unicode symbols in different writing systems and non-printing characters (e.g. right-to-left mark) with unicodedata
* creating SQLite database, connecting and quering it with SQLAlchemy
* Bootstrap/HTML/CSS
* Flask
* Basic Javascript to create dynamic dropdown lists, pagination, and concordance sorting
* Basic jQuery to handle element attributes
